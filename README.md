Probabilistic_semantic_mapping

Stacks include:
  - `aizo_quadrotor_slam`: 2D SLAM based on CaroGrapher and TEB motion planning
  - `oj_detection`: tracker and extracted object, real-time object detection using the Ultralytics YOLO
  - The `object_detector_node` provides real-time object detection on incoming ROS image messages using the Ultralytics YOLO model.
  - The `tracker_with_cloud_node` provides functionality for 3D object detection by integrating 2D detections, LiDAR data, and camera information.
